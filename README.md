## Routing in a React app
- Install a third party package
- Routes.js file to configure the routes
- For each route, create a component file, export the component, import it in routes.js and configure the new route with a path property

## Routing in a Next.js app
- File-system based routing mechanism
- When a file is added to the pages folder in a project, it automatically becomes available as a route
- By mixing and matching file names with a nested folder structure, it is possible to pretty much define the most common routing patterns

## Routing in a Next.js app
- Route with pages
- Nested routes
- Dynamic routes
- Catch-all routes
- Navigate from the UI
- Programmatically navigate b/w pages
