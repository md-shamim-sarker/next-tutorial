/*
Routing Section Intro:

Routing in a React app
* Install a third party package
* routes.js file to configure the routes
* For each route, create a component file, export the component, import it in routes.js and configure the new route with a path property

Routing in a Next.js app
*  File-system based routing mechanism
*  When a file is added to the pages folder in a project, it automatically becomes available as a route
* By mixing and matching file names with a nested folder structure, it is possible to pretty much define the most common routing patterns

Routing in a Next.js app
* Route with pages
* Nested routes
* Dynamic routes
* Catch-all routes
* Navigate from the UI
* Programmatically navigate b/w pages
